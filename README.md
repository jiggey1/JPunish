# JPunish
A Standalone Punishment Plugin Made For 1.15.2+ Minecraft using the MF-GUI's Framework!

## How Does It Work?
JPunish is a graphical way to punish a member on your server. This means it has a GUI to Ban, Kick, Mute or Freeze a member.

JPunish is simply a faster way to ban, kick or mute someone. It simply brings up a GUI with custom reasons. When the item is selected,
it runs the command. For example: If you select "Malicious Hacks" on the menu, it will run the command "/ban {player_name} {duration} {reason}".

The reasons, item lore and the duration are completely custom! Just make your changes in the config.yml and reload using the built-in command! "/jpunish reload"

## What's the point?
This plugin is primarily meant for bigger servers who have many players violating the same rules. Whether it be PVP Hacks, ban evading, spam, etc. This plugin
makes it a lot easier *and faster* to ban for the same reasons!

The plugin is meant to be used alongside other banning / kick plugins, so the layout (and command format) doesn't cause any issues. The main plugin that this should
be used with is **LiteBans**, however it's compatible with most other plugins.
